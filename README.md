# hackathon2024

## The data.py file contains example code for my team's hackathon project with the theme 'Innovate for social good'. We designed an app aimed at students to help sort through their tasks. We employed a 'tinder-like' swiping mechanism where users will swipe the task that they feel is more urgent to get done. This continues until the user will then recieve a to-do list with their priorities organized in the app. The app also has a movies and tv show feature which helps users to decide what to watch during their rest time to promote mental health management. This section uses the same mechanic of picking genres the user would like to watch and then swiping on which movie/show they prefer to watch and the app creates a list of recommendations.
